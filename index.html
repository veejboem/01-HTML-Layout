    <h2>The Imbalance of Culture Fit</h2>
    <h4>by Matt Griffin 11 comments</h4>

    <p>Part of getting to a better place in the new year is recognizing where we
      have sway, and going past our own discomfort to create positive change in
      ourselves and in the world. Those of us who have a role in the hiring
      process can do better by thinking critically about culture fit. Matt 
      Griffin challenges us to consider whether it actually creates the kind of
      team that’s the best for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make us
      comfortable by surrounding us with people largely like ourselves in ways
      that aren’t relevant to the business.</p>
